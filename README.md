  - Define and differentiate between modules and packages in Python.  
  - Understand their use cases and organizational structure.  

- **Explore Different Ways to Import Modules**  
  - Use `import` statements to load built-in and custom modules.  
  - Use `from module import` syntax for selective imports.  
  - Understand aliasing and wildcard imports.  

- **Differentiate Between Mutable and Immutable Types**

  - Identify immutable types such as integers, strings, and tuples.  

- **Understand Variables and Memory References**  
  - Learn how Python variables store references to objects in memory.  
  - Explore how reassignment affects references and object mutability.  

- **Work with the Boolean Type and Operators**  
  - Use boolean values (`True`, `False`) in logical expressions.  
  - Understand logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).  

- **Manipulate Strings and Perform String Operations**  
  - Create and manipulate string objects.  
  - Use string slicing, indexing, and formatting methods.  
  - Apply common string operations such as concatenation.  

- **Understand Numeric Types (`int` and `float`)**  
  - Differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers.  
  - Perform arithmetic operations on numeric data.  
  - Work with type conversions between numeric types.

  - Unpack iterables and dictionaries in function calls.  

- **Enhance Code Readability with Type Hints**  
  - Implement type hints to clarify function inputs and outputs.  
  - Use Python’s `typing` module for specifying generic and optional types.  

- **Manage Nested Functions**  
  - Define and use functions inside other functions.
